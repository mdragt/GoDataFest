# Workshop 2 Automated ML - Predict Wine Quality

In this case, you want to predict the quality of wine. We used a dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository that contained 6497 observations with physicochemical properties of red and white Portuguese wine and their quality (Cortez).

# Steps

## Get the data

You can obtain the data 'winedata.csv' from the GitHub repo [Wine Quality](https://github.com/mdragt/WineQuality)

Open an Edge browser and go to the new [Azure Machine Learning environment](https://ml.azure.com). *Note: this environment is in preview, so glitches can appear.*

Go to Datasets and select Create dataset, from local file.
