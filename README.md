GoDataFest Azure Machine Learning Workshops

## Workshop 1: Custom Vision AI - Creating applications that can see, hear, speak or understand - using Microsoft Cognitive Services (1 hour)

In this workshop you will be introduced to the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, a range of offerings you can use to infuse intelligence and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch. We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as computer vision, that are accessed by REST protocol. Next we will dive into Custom AI that uses transfer learning - Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. This enables you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model. Wrapping the workshop up by building our custom trained AI into an application - using Logic Apps, this technology is ideal for building data pipeline processes that work with your machine learning models.
